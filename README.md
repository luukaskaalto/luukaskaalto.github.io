## Simulation
### Overview
- [TACTO](https://github.com/facebookresearch/tacto) acts as the simulation platform. Refer to the documentation for the installation and instructions.
- [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) provides the implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.
- [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) acts as the base gym environment for the agent training.

The purpose of the simulation is to explore the possibilities of the robot hand by training RL-agents to complete suitable hand manipulation tasks before replicating them in real life. The simulation platform provides the possibility to transfer agents from sim-to-real by pre-training agents in a simulation before training them in real world environments.

### Using TACTO to simulate & train agents
#### 1. Valve Agent
The first step of the project is to train a simple valve-turning agent to rotate a valve handle by 180 degrees.
